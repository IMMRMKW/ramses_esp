**RAMSES_ESP** is a port of [evofw3](https://github.com/ghoti57/evofw3) to an Espressif esp32-s3 platform

The esp32-s3 interfaces to a TI CC1101 radio.

In addition to the USB serial interface provided by HGI80 and evofw3 based devices RAMSES_ESP also implements an MQTT interface to host applications.

This provides the ability to release the device from the need to be co-located with the system running the host application.  All the device needs is USB power. 

You can buy an Espressif [esp32-s3 + CC1101 USB stick](https://github.com/IndaloTech/ramses_esp/wiki/Hardware) here
